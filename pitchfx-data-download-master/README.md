# pitchfx-data-download
This is a .NET console app to download and parse PitchF/X data. There is also a SQL script to create a database where the data will be stored. You will need to setup a password for the user, in my case pitchfxuser, and change the connection string in the program's app.config file. Running the application with no parameters will collect all data for yesterday's date. Use -h or -help to display a help menu. Use -startdate and -enddate to specify a range of dates for which to collect data. Dates should be in the format m-d-yyyy.
